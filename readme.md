## About this script
This is a small script to import/export mod lists from your HOI4 installation, which is achieved by modifying the launcher's ``settings.txt`` file.
In order for this to work, you need to have all mods you're importing installed.

You can find a standalone Windows executable (generated using PyInstaller) in the ``dist`` folder.

You can use the provided ``config.ini`` to override the default path in which the script looks for the ``settings.txt`` file.

## Prerequisites (if you're not using the Windows executable)
``Python 3`` (I think)
